Seeing Machines works with the world\u2019s leading brands (eg. General Motors, Mercedes Benz, Qantas, Caterpillar, Toll) across multiple transport sectors of automotive, commercial road transport (Fleet), and aviation to enhance safety.\n\n\nAbout The Role:\u00a0\n\n\nThe Senior Machine Learning Scientist will work directly with internal stakeholders to develop occupant monitoring features using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (eg NN, CNNs, RNNs), traditional computer vision techniques, or often a combination of both. \n\n\nOne aspect of feature development includes collaborating with Human Factors Research Scientists and Data Acquisition Specialists to help collect relevant, truthed datasets. Also required is working closely with our Performance Analysis Team to ensure that we can measure and validate the performance of the algorithms.\n\n\nAbout The Algorithm Development Team:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nSeeing Machines works with the world\u2019s leading OEMs to deliver state-of-the-art operator monitoring technology across our chosen transport sectors of commercial road transport (Fleet), automotive, and aviation. In Fleet, our best-in-class aftermarket product Guardian provides drivers and fleet operators real-time protection from distraction and fatigue events. In automotive, we enable safer Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving (AD) solutions. In aviation, our advanced gaze tracking technology understands how pilots interact and monitor instruments \u2013 leading to better training and safer operations. \n\n\nThe Algorithm Development Team brings cutting edge research in areas such as fatigue and distraction detection into occupant monitoring solutions. Take an example of fatigue detection, which is conceptually simple \u2013 just detect when someone looks tired, right? To develop this feature, there are many underlying details that need to be understood. For example, how do you collect a dataset safely? What is the true drowsiness level? How to account for individual behavioural differences? Algorithm Development Team members work closely with Human Factors Research Scientists, Data Acquisition Specialists and Machine Intelligence Researchers in order to make progress on these kinds of questions in order to develop features.\n\n\nAside from developing new features, the Algorithm Development Team also helps improve existing features that are currently used by customers. For example, making improvements to handle specific real-world corner cases, improving performance, etc. \n\n\nAbout the role:\u00a0\n\n\nDeveloping proof of concept algorithms and prototypes for features that will be continually evolving in Python and C++.\n\n\nTaking the technical lead on development of one or more algorithms.\n\n\nWriting clear documentation to help define features, including use cases, dataset specifications, performance targets, etc.\n\n\nMaking use of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques (eg NN, CNN, RNN) utilizing large datasets to train algorithms.\n\n\nProviding guidance to embedded software engineers to enable algorithms to be used on specific embedded hardware platforms.\n\n\nAssisting with business pursuit activities such as working with potential partners, assisting customers to evaluate our technology and fielding questions from customers.\n\n\nResponding to customer-reported issues when required in order to fix problems or limitations encountered in real-world conditions.\n\n\nEducational Qualification:\n\n\nA Masters or PhD (awarded or currently completing) in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, or equivalent industry experience\n\n\nEducational Experience:\n\n\nEssential \n\n\n3+ years of industry or postdoc experience.\n\n\nStrong theoretical understanding of machine learning concepts such as CNNs, RNNs, etc.\n\n\nExperience with machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch or similar.\n\n\nExperience writing code in Python and/or C++, ideally in a commercial environment.\n\n\nEvidence of producing high-quality research outcomes and in disseminating effectively to academic and industry settings. \n\n\nDesirable \n\n\nUnderstanding of traditional computer vision and/or image processing techniques.\n\n\nExperience working on research in a commercial environment.\n\n\n\n\nExperience with practical data science or statistical analysis.\n\n\nExperience explaining and discussing technical topics with varied audiences.

Work that meant something. So how about you help tackle the cost of living crisis in Australia, whilst supporting a move to green energy?\u00a0\n \u00a0\n You\u2019d join a team of 30, with around 10 tech specialists ranging from data, developers, embedded software and electronics engineers.\n They\u2019re taking a world-first approach to solar energy. Creating a platform that allows its users to trade energy through a sophisticated system of remote networks and VPNs deployed, nationally.\u00a0\n Sure anyone can put solar panels on their roof.

There\u2019s already a strong DevOps philosophy. So tools like Terraform, Crossplane, Docker, Postgres and Kafka are already there.\u00a0\n \u00a0\n The advantage of doing this early on in a small business is things will move quickly. You can access the knowledge you need to get into the weeds for provisioning new services.\u00a0\n You\u2019ll enjoy the flexible hours and option to work from home 4 days a week.
